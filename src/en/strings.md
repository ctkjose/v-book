# Strings  {menu:topics}

In **V**, a string is a sequence of characters used to represent text.

V uses the [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoding for strings. We will dive deeper into [unicode and encodings](#encodings) later, but for now, let's starts with a simple overview of UTF-8. In early computing history, we had one-byte character systems that were limited to 256 symbols, mostly used for the Latin characters and basic symbols. UTF-8 is a multi-byte system that allows us to represent thousands of symbols needed for all the languages and it even has space left for emojis.


# Creating Strings {menu:topics}

A string [variable](./variables.md) is defined by assigning a literal string using either single or double quotes to delimit the start and end of the string.

{class:v-play}
```v
fn main(){
	my_email := 'jose@example.com'

	message := "This is a message in double quotes."

	my_string_with_single_quote := "It's a string with a single quote."

	println(my_string_with_single_quote)
}
```
In this example, we created three string variables. Notice that in `my_string_with_single_quote` the string value contains a single quote, therefore we use double quotes to delimit the start and end of the string.

> In **V**, we prefer to use single quotes, but either one works.

{class:v-play}
```v
fn main(){
	mut msg := 'hello ðŸŒŽ' //<-- string with  multi-byte unicode characters
	println(msg)
}
```

For now we can think of the string variables as a series of bytes ('u8'). However, it's important to note that not all characters use one byte. In fact, only the traditional 127 Latin characters of [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) use a single byte, everything else is multiple bytes (two or more).

# Mutability of strings {menu:topics}

We need to make the distinction between the string data and a string variable. A string variable holds our string. The contents of the [variable](./variables.md) can be modified by adding the `mut` prefix.

```v
fn main(){
	mut msg := 'hello ðŸŒŽ' //<-- create a string variable
	msg = 'Hello ðŸŒŽ' //<-- assign a new string to the variable
}
```
In **V**, strings are immutable; the data of the string itself can not be modified. However, this is different to the mutability of the variable holding the string data. As we saw in the previous example, we can assign a new string to a variable if we declare the [variable](./variables.md) with `mut`.

Any operation on strings produces a new string. 

# String concatenation and interpolation {menu:topics}

The process of combining/adding two or multiple strings to form a single string is called concatenation. The simplest way to concatenate strings in **V** is using the `+` operator.

{class:v-play}
```v
fn main(){	
	name := 'Joe'
	message := 'Hello ' + name
	println(message) //<-- Outputs "Hello Joe"
}
```

In this example, we have two strings `'Hello '` and the string in the variable `name` and we combine (concatenate) them to form a third new string that gets assigned to the variable `message`.

With a mutable string variable we can use the append operator `+=` to add a string to an existing string.

{class:v-play}
```v
fn main(){	
	
	mut message := 'Hello '
	message += 'Joe'
	println(message) //<-- Outputs "Hello Joe"
}
```

When doing concatenation the receiving variable must be a string or a new variable being declare. Both values must be strings, **V** does not do implicit type conversion.

To concatenate numbers or other values we must convert does values to string first. Numbers in V implement the method `.str()` to convert them to a string. Lets see an example:

{class:v-play}
```v
fn main(){	
	code := 245
	mut message := 'The code is ' + code.str()
	println(message) //<-- Outputs "The code is 245"
}
```

## Length Property {menu:topics;class:v-member-string}

The length of a string (number of bytes) can be obtained using the `.len` field.

{class:v-play}
```v
fn main(){
	message := 'Hello ðŸŒŽ'
	println(message.len) // Output: 10
	
	if message.len > 0 {
		println('Message is not empty...')
	}
}
```
In this example, we use the [structs](./structs.md) syntax to operate on a string. **Notice** that the string length is 10 and not 7, this is because the `len` property counts bytes and not characters. 



## Encodings and Code Points {menu:topics:menu-id:encodings}

In **V**, **strings** are just a sequence of bytes for example the string "hello" is made of the corresponding 4 bytes (where a byte is `u8` number) for each character on the string, in this case `"h"=104 (0x68)`, `"e"=101 (0x65)`, `"l"=108 (0x6C)`, `"l"=108 (0x6C)`, `"o"=111 (0x6F)`. 

{class:v-play}
```v
s := 'hello'
println(s.len) //<-- will ouput 4

ch := s[0] //<-- get byte at position 0
println(ch) //<-- will output 104  (0x68)
```

> Thinking of strings as an array of `u8` is a great way to visualize them. In fact we will see later that we can operate on strings in a similar way we do with [arrays](./arrays.md).

For basic strings without [unicode characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) a character takes exactly one byte (8-bits) and there are 256 (0-255) possible symbols that can be represented by them. What character you see in your screen depends on the **encoding**. A **character encoding** is a system where we map or assign a unique numerical value to each character. The encoding tells how many bits are used to represent each symbol. Like you can imagine there are many encodings and depending what encoding your application (terminal, browser, text editor) or operating system is configured to use is what you actually see.

The basic [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) encoding used 7 bits ( which fits in 1 byte, *an `u8` in V* ) to represent the basic latin alphabet with 128 characters. With the need to represent more symbols later encodings like [ASCII-Extended, ISO 8859-1, Windows-1252](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_ASCII) used 8 bits ( 1 byte, *which is an `u8` in V* ) to represent 256 symbols. These encodings in particular ISO 8859-1 covered most latin based languages and Western European languages. Up to this point in history one byte represented one character on the **string**. Nevertheless this was not enough to cover all other languages like Asians, Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic and many more.

In 1989 the [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoding  was created to solve this issue. In UTF-8 a character can be represented with 1 byte or up-to 4 bytes. One byte covers the original 128 characters of ASCII. With the addition of two bytes a total of 1,920 more symbols were added which covers almost all Latin-script alphabets, Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic and more. Three bytes added 61,440 characters which covered Japanese, Chinese and Korean characters. With four bytes, the we got emojis and many more symbols. UTF-8 quickly became the most common encoding and is the encoding used by **V**.

To represent characters beyond the first 127 characters in UTF-8 we use from 2 to 4 bytes. For example the character `h` takes one byte with a numerical value of `104` or `0x68` ; the character `Ãœ` takes two bytes   `0xC39C` and the emoji ðŸŒŽ takes four bytes `0xF09F97BA`.

A code-point is a reference number assigned to a character in the unicode tables and it is written as "U+" and the character number in hexadecimal. For example the character `h` is code-point `U+0068`, the character `Ãœ` is code-point `U+00DC` and ðŸŒŽ is `U+1F5FA`.

In **V**, we use a `u8` number to represent a byte, but how do we represent multi-byte characters in V?

## Runes {menu:topics}

A [**rune**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runes) is a programming term for a `u32` number that represents a Unicode code-point. When working with unicode strings we no longer work with the underlying bytes, but instead we operate on the **runes** (code-points) that make up the string.

In **V**, we use the syntax &#96;ðŸŒŽ&#96; to represent **runes**.

{class:v-play}
```v
s := 'ðŸŒŽ' //<-- this is a string with unicode characters
println(s.len) //<-- will ouput 4 bytes

abyte := &#96;ðŸŒŽ&#96; //<-- get byte at position 6
println(abyte) //<-- will output the byte value 240  (0xF0)
```





# Inspecting and Manipulating {menu:topics}

In **V**, strings have fields and methods similar to [structs](./structs.md) that we can use to inspect or operate on strings.

The official documentation of string methods is available [here](https://modules.vlang.io/strings.html).






# Raw Strings

Raw Strings: V also supports raw strings, which are useful when you want to include backslashes or other special characters literally without escaping them. Raw strings are prefixed with r.

```v

fn main(){
	raw_path := r'C:\Users\YourName\Documents'
	multiline_raw_string := r'''
This is a
multi-line
raw string.
'''

	println(raw_path)
	println(multiline_raw_string)
}
```
