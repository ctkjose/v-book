# V Community Book

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive programming book to learn V regardless if you are new to programming or have prior knowledge in other languages.

This book is meant to be open and available to as many people as possible. You can join our efforts and help translate this book in your language.

# V Lang {menu:topics}

The [V Language](https://vlang.io) is a young modern programming language that aspire for code that is simple, readable and maintainable.  **V** is the brain child of `Alexander Medvednikov` supported by an open community. The **V Language** is a community base open source project.


This design mantra defines most aspects of the language implementation. For most things in **V** there is one way to do things this means less things to learn and code that is easier to read. The language prioritize **value semantics** of immutable data, that is how data is used and accessed. We explicitly put our intent in the code we write and everything is locked unless you explicitly make it mutable. In **V** type safety is the byproduct of having simple and explicit value semantics.
