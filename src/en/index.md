# V Community Book

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive programming book to learn V regardless if you are new to programming or have prior knowledge in other languages.

This book is meant to be open and available to as many people as possible. You can join our efforts and help translate this book in your language.

# V Lang {menu:topics}

 The **V programming language** is an open source language created by `Alexander Medvednikov` and supported by a community or driven individuals.

The [V Language](https://vlang.io) is a young programming language with a very pragmatic approach. It attempts to tackle the same issues as the many modern languages like Go and Rust do, but keeping the language simple, easy to read and to maintain. In fact the V language has similar syntax compared to the popular Go programming language and borrows many popular ideas from languages like Rust, Python, Swift, Kotlin and many others. One distinction we like to make with **V** is that you will like sensible choices made in the language, it's about simplicity, code that is easy to read and advance features that are easy to master.

While **V** is still a very young language born outside of Big-Tech it has deliver some robust features and performance in its short life and we cant wait to see what **V** becomes on it's first release.
