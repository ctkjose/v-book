# Read.V {menu:topics}

Welcome to **Read.V** a community book for programmers and humans wishing to learn the V Programming Language.

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive book that everybody can enjoy regardless if you are new to programming or have prior knowledge in other languages.


# V Lang {menu:topics}

 The **V programming language** is an open source language created by `Alexander Medvednikov` and supported by a community or driven individuals.

The [V Language](https://vlang.io) is a new programming language that prioritizes simplicity and readability while addressing the common concerns tackled by other modern languages such as Go, Zig and Rust. V’s syntax is similar to Go’s while incorporating concepts from languages like Rust, Python, Swift, and Kotlin.

V is a very young language developed by a driven community that has delivered a fresh take on modern programming paradigms.
