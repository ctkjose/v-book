# Backends

As of 2021 the main backend of V is C. Using C as a backend frees the community to spend their resources on building the language itself. The C ecosystems brings extensive tooling and platform support. Using C, V can take advantage of new compiler technologies like LLVM without having to spend the time themselves.

We like a comment posted on this [thread](https://github.com/vlang/v/discussions/7849), "C is the key ingredient of the concrete poured into the foundations of this civilization." and V seats on top of those foundations.
