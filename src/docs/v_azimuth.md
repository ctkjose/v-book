# Azimuth  {menu:topics}

We all joke that every day we get a new programming language. You heard of V and may be wondering if V deserves your attention. V is yet another language in this see of options all claiming some novel ideas..

Unfortunately, programming languages often give rise to communities that become ideological silos. In its early days, the V community became entangled in online drama where critics attacked the merits of the project, and some claimed a deceiving state of the project and its capabilities. In reality, Vâ€™s story is not unlike that of many other community-driven languages.

As a young language, V is still defining itself, testing ideas and staying pragmatic about its goals. One challenge the V community faces is that most contributors are focused on developing the language itself, which means communication and documentation often take a back seat.

While the language is not set on stone, this article is my personal attempt to document the ideas behind V, its philosophy, and its direction.

> Disclaimer: This is not an official communication from the V-Lang Project. Please understand that this article is not a formal dissertation on language design, nor does it offer a systematic comparison of languages and features. It is simply a collection of thoughts and opinions on V's design.

# Syntax

While V is heavily inspired by Go and shares some syntactic similarities, it also introduces its own unique features and design choices, particularly around safety, simplicity, and C interoperability. While both languages offer a simple and minimalist syntax, **V** goes further in many aspects.

 V reduces the number of language constructs to make the language even easier to learn and read. There is generally one-way to express a construct and its meaning is fairly explicit to the reader. In this sense the language syntax is stricter and in some instances requires you to write more verbose code. For example Go "multi-value returns" for error handling may let you write code that doesn't check an error condition. In V you use optionals and result types (similar to Rust) which forces you to handle the error. Yet for the most part the V syntax is less verbose than Go and much more readable than Zig or Rust (IMHO ðŸ¤“).
 
 ```v
 fn divide(a f64, b f64) !f64 { // !f64 indicates it returns a result or an error
	 if b == 0.0 {
		 return error('division by zero')
	 }
	 return a / b
 }
 
 fn main() {
	 result1 := divide(10.0, 2.0) or {
		 println('Error: ${err.msg}') // err is implicitly available in or block
		 return // Or handle differently
	 }
	 println('Result 1: ${result1}')
 
	 result2 := divide(10.0, 0.0) or {
		 println('Error: ${err.msg}')
		 return
	 }
	 // This line won't be reached if the second divide fails and returns
	 println('Result 2: ${result2}')
 }
 ```
 
 In many instances you will notice that V replaces Go syntax constructs with simpler versions. Being a younger language, V still has the opportunity to draw inspiration from other languages before its syntax is finalized.
 
 In the Discord Server you will find many discussions around ensuring that the meaning of a language construct is not ambiguous. 



# Backends

As of 2021, the primary backend for V is C. Using C allows the community to focus on building the language itself. The C ecosystem provides extensive tooling and cross-platform support. It's a pragmatic choice that enables the generation of production-ready, performant binaries.

LLVM is another possible backend. As a widely used compiler infrastructure, LLVM brings a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries. While LLVM could eventually serve as an alternative backend for V, using C allows us to leverage Clangâ€™s LLVM capabilities today, while retaining flexibility for future tooling options.


# Types and Generics

no implicit casting, no global state
 


# To organize....

This [discussion](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go/discussions/411) on Microsoft's decision to use Go for Native TypeScript brings up many perspectives on language ecosystems, tooling, and performance. Many appreciate Goâ€™s ease of development and compatibility, while acknowledging it may not be the most performant. Optimizing code generation is a complex task. Could backends like LLVM eventually become preferred?

Their official statement on the GoLLVM project [reads](https://go.googlesource.com/gollvm):  
> "Gollvm is intended to provide a Go compiler with a more powerful back end, enabling such benefits as better inlining, vectorization, register allocation, etc."

I appreciated one comment posted on this [thread](https://github.com/vlang/v/discussions/7849):  
> "C is the key ingredient of the concrete poured into the foundations of this civilization."  
V sits atop those foundations.
